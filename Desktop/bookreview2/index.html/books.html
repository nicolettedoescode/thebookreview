              <h2>Inherit the Wind (courtroom drama)</h2>
              <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee</p>
              <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
              <p><strong>Review:</strong>
                <p>Yes, Inherit the Wind is based on real events, specifically the 1925 Scopes "Monkey" Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, where teacher John Scopes was prosecuted for teaching evolution in violation of the state's Butler Act, which banned the teaching of theories contradicting the biblical creation story. It is a dramatized real-life courtroom drama in play form and thus, it is the pinnacle of the intersection of law and religion and literal direct reality. This is done substantially well and is just honestly filled with a lot of very meaningful quotes. Although the prohibited law was based on the Bible, the principles are shared and relevant to many other religions including Islam, obviously discussing the story of Adam and Eve against evolution. I don’t read a lot of books that criticize religion, and so this was very entertaining to read—a pleasant surprise. Reading it blindly, I didn’t know what to expect; I just thought it would be interesting to read before I started studying law in university, and I just remember being really impressed even by the court process as well as thematic developments in this play. I also think the fact that it's a play is a good choice; symbolizing religion against science in a courtroom, dramatizing it, putting religion and science literally on trial at the mercy or intersection of law. So basically, this play is so short and, as you can tell, has a lot of meaning, so I'd recommend this book to literally anyone. It’s like you can imagine what the play is in your head since you're not reading any fillers and just the play itself and what the characters say, which centers your attention around what's being said and not how the play actually looks. This gives creative freedom when imagining what the events look like and what the characters look like/sound like, etc., but most importantly, you are free to disagree and agree with what's being said and free to make your own conclusions since there's no bias of explanatory text involved. Whichever side you choose to agree with, or if you remain neutral, it’s obvious that even if you're not interested in law, you'd be interested in the drama. And oh, the drama that there is for real. I read this a while ago and I highlighted so much of the book which proves the characters actually had something to say and I had to read a summary to write this since I completely forgot what happened.</p>
                        <p>The title of the play comes from Proverbs 11:29 – “He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind” – reflecting the play's critique of those who jeopardize intellectual freedom for political gain.</p>
                        <p>Interestingly, the play was written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee in 1955. The play dramatizes the Scopes trial but also critiques the anti-communist McCarthyism of its time, and so it’s an active critique of other works, which just adds to the drama honestly, almost like interception. Moreover, Lawrence and Lee saw figures like Senator McCarthy as threats to democracy, similar to the dictators America had fought in World War II. At its core, the play critiques McCarthyism and continues to resonate today when politicians try to control what can be taught in schools.</p>
                        <p>Lawrence and Lee, veterans of Armed Forces Radio, wrote Inherit the Wind as a response to the threat posed by McCarthy’s anti-communist crusades. They viewed him as undermining democracy, much like the dictatorial regimes the U.S. had fought against during WWII.</p>
                        <p>The play dramatizes the 1925 Scopes trial, where a teacher was prosecuted for teaching evolution, violating Tennessee’s anti-evolution law. Famous lawyers William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow clashed in a highly publicized case. The trial’s clash between traditionalism and intellectual freedom unfolded in a carnival-like setting, with Bryan defending biblical literalism and Darrow championing free thought. That just makes this play even better honestly. Journalist H.L. Mencken covered the event, which attracted national attention.</p>
                        <p>The play, set in the fictional town of Hillsboro, features Bertram Cates (representing Scopes), a teacher prosecuted for teaching Darwin’s evolution theory. The trial reflects a larger conflict between traditionalists, who took the Bible literally, and modernists, who sought to reconcile faith with science. The lawmakers behind the Butler Law weren’t merely protecting religion—they were pushing a political agenda aimed at keeping society aligned with their own values. Separately, one could also say the extreme of only science believers also have the space to be represented here perhaps, as I’m not sure if the "science" defense's goal was to reconcile faith with science or just defend science, but again, I don’t remember a lot of the book anymore to really clear that critique up.</p>
                        <p>The courtroom drama unfolds with Matthew Harrison Brady (based on Bryan) and Henry Drummond (based on Darrow) sparring over the right to think freely. In a pivotal moment, Drummond exposes the contradictions in Brady’s literalist interpretation of the Bible, symbolizing the clash between orthodoxy and free thought.</p>
                        <p>For example, in a climactic scene, Drummond dissects Brady’s literalist views on the Bible, particularly the story of Joshua making the sun stand still. He traps Brady into admitting that biblical “days” might not be 24 hours long, undermining his rigid stance and highlighting the contradictions in his beliefs. I think this is a very good reflection on double thinking (from 1984) but rather when your contradictions are created literally by yourself and stubbornness, unconscious bias, etc., all interlink as almost a performative defense which is wholeheartedly right to you, but at the same time, entirely wrong, or partially wrong. Essentially, this spotlights entirely stubbornness and encompasses this cascade very well into the play, doing so using only the speech of characters.</p>
                        <p>In the end of Inherit the Wind, Cates is found guilty of violating the anti-evolution law, but the judge imposes a minimal fine, recognizing the trial's impact on Cates' reputation. Brady, once a powerful figure, is portrayed as broken and defeated, while Drummond remains steadfast in his commitment to intellectual freedom. The final scene shows Drummond and Hornbeck leaving the courthouse, with Drummond carrying both the Bible and Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, symbolizing the ongoing struggle between religious faith and scientific thought. The ending emphasizes the persistent conflict between tradition and progress and the importance of continuing the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
                        <p>This is accurate and is what happened in the real case however, the case was immediately appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court. Although the court upheld the conviction, it overturned the fine on a technicality, ruling that the fine should have been imposed by the jury rather than the judge. Scopes never actually had to pay the fine, as the appeal had already been resolved by the time of the final ruling.</p>
                        <p>Arguably, one could read this as a complete critique of religion or, at a minimum, the Bible entirely. However, I would find this an extreme perspective and I feel like you’d miss the whole point of the play. Nandakishore Mridula says that "the opening scene between the children sets the tone - when little Howard says that he came from a worm which crawled out of the sea, we can see that the gates to free thought have been opened in at least one tender mind.” I mean, like, who hurt you? Then he contradictorily adds, "as the play progresses and the action alternates between the town and the courthouse, the audience can see a people being slowly transformed: they still believe in the Bible, yet they can now accept someone else can have a different line of thought." I mean, it’s not like the law really prevented individual thought but just stopped the spread of teaching things that didn’t fit the agenda of the law, and more so prevented the spread of information and arguably not the thought itself. Like I’m sure people were questioning it since this was just one law in one state, but I get it anyways. The cross-examination of Brady as a witness for the defense (which really happened) by Drummond is the heart of the play - the literal interpretation of scripture could be defined as a "foolish exercise it is" and I'd also add that there's room to question if the law and religion are better separate or not, or a hybrid of the two, although this would lead to more questions including how far is too much, or not enough involvement. However, I agree that the real target of the drama is the audience, and this sequence is bound to set at least some minds in the theater thinking.</p>
                        <p>Anyways, the play’s relevance continues, as political groups still seek to control what can be taught in schools—whether it’s the 2005 Dover case over intelligent design or more recent attempts to ban critical race theory. Inherit the Wind serves as a timeless reminder that the battle for intellectual freedom endures. The people threatening that freedom often believe they’re acting for a noble cause, but as Drummond observes, the search for truth is far more important than claims of being "right" or "wrong." Thus, because of a very illuminating, exciting, and interactive background, it is deserving of a 5-star rating. However, it ain’t getting one. It’s getting a subjective and interchangeable 4 just because I kind of think it’s criticizing religion and leaves no room, or at a minimum not enough

<p>Conclusively, I think that if you are religious it just makes you think that maybe strict religion is such a foreign concept in the west its just a little offensive or wrong to read i guess, but i agree freedom of thought and to afree or disagree should exist, but like no one said being religious didnt let you do these things. Its weird, even if the play doesnt leave room for the authours opinion, just character speech, it still feels biased, which i guess 'scientifically' doesnt belong in a literal play about freedom of speech apparently but has an undertone on the freedom to agree with the religious debate. Anyways, if you are interested, id suggest forming your own opinion by reading either the play or the real case. If the following quotes dont make you want to read this i guess your limiting your beleifs lol. </p>

        <h2>Christina Rossetti: Selected Poems</h2>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Christina Rossetti</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> This was a decent selection of poems. I read these during lockdown during A-levels and came back to this recently. No, I didn't read them all, but I'll add two poems I enjoyed here. There's a lot of imagery and meaning, although some poems are better than others, which is expected when looking at poems. This is a good example of a woman who wrote a selection of poems while she was in her feelings, so a lot of the poems are about romance and love, which I really like.</p>

          <h2>The Art of Seduction</h2>
          <p><strong>Author:</strong> Robert Greene</p>
          <p><strong>Published:</strong> 2006</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p><strong>Review:</strong> This guy just can't write a bad book. I'll automatically give him a 5/5 at this point just because he spits facts. He's joining Margret Atwood as one of my favorite authors, although not beating her in fiction. If controversy surrounds every book he writes, he's got to have accuracy in what he's saying, right? If what he talks about is considered to be that controversial and manipulative, it's crazy to think how accurate what he says is. Moreover, the historical influences and examples never miss.</p>
          <p>Here are a few; Cleopatra, the Siren, captivated Julius Caesar and Mark Antony with her beauty and dramatic presence, consolidating her power. Giacomo Casanova, the Rake, used his relentless charm and passion to make each woman he pursued feel uniquely desired. Marie Antoinette, the Ideal Lover, crafted an image of elegance and beauty that resonated with the French aristocracy despite political challenges. Napoleon Bonaparte, the Charismatic, inspired loyalty and admiration through his confidence and vision, gaining a devoted following and rising to power.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Greene examines other figures such as Josephine Bonaparte, the Coquette, who used charm and emotional distance to keep Napoleon intrigued; Pope Alexander VI, the Charismatic, who leveraged his magnetism and political savvy to control and influence others; Countess Elizabeth Báthory, the Star, who cultivated an aura of mystery and high status; and Mata Hari, the Dandy, who captivated with her androgynous style and performances, manipulating powerful men and navigating complex political situations.</p>

              <h3>The Seductive Process</h3>
              <p>This section outlines the steps involved in seducing someone, from the initial attraction to the consummation of the relationship.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Choose the Right Victim:</strong> Select a target who is susceptible to your particular type of seduction. Understanding the target’s desires and vulnerabilities is key to a successful seduction.</li>
                  <li><strong>Create a False Sense of Security – Approach Indirectly:</strong> Engage the target without making your intentions obvious. Subtlety and indirect approaches make the target feel comfortable and lower their defenses.</li>
                  <li><strong>Send Mixed Signals:</strong> Use ambiguity to confuse and intrigue the target. By sending mixed signals, you keep them off balance and more invested in figuring you out.</li>
                  <li><strong>Appear to Be an Object of Desire:</strong> Make yourself appear desirable by surrounding yourself with admirers or creating the perception that others find you attractive. This taps into the target’s competitive instincts.</li>
                  <li><strong>Create a Need – Stir Anxiety and Discontent:</strong> Identify what the target lacks or what they are anxious about, and position yourself as the solution. This creates a dependency on you for fulfillment.</li>
                  <li><strong>Master the Art of Insinuation:</strong> Use suggestion and implication rather than direct statements to plant ideas in the target’s mind. This allows them to come to conclusions on their own, making them more invested in the seduction.</li>
                  <li><strong>Enter Their Spirit:</strong> Show empathy and align yourself with the target’s emotions and moods. By reflecting their feelings, you create a deep emotional connection.</li>
                  <li><strong>Create Temptation:</strong> Dangle something tempting and forbidden in front of the target. The allure of the forbidden increases the target’s desire and interest.</li>
                  <li><strong>Keep Them in Suspense – What Comes Next?:</strong> Use unpredictability to keep the target hooked. By keeping your actions and intentions unclear, you keep the target intrigued and focused on you.</li>
                  <li><strong>Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion:</strong> Use language to manipulate the target’s perception, creating confusion and doubt. This makes them more reliant on you for clarity and direction.</li>
                  <li><strong>Pay Attention to Detail:</strong> Small gestures and attention to details in your interactions make the target feel valued and noticed. These details can have a significant impact on the target’s emotions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Poeticize Your Presence:</strong> Create a sense of drama and mystery around yourself. By being elusive and enigmatic, you increase your allure and keep the target’s interest alive.</li>
                  <li><strong>Disarm Through Strategic Weakness and Vulnerability:</strong> Show vulnerability at key moments to disarm the target and create a sense of intimacy. This makes the target feel closer to you and more protective.</li>
                  <li><strong>Confuse Desire and Reality – The Perfect Illusion:</strong> Blur the lines between fantasy and reality in your interactions, making the target question what is real and what is imagined. This deepens their emotional involvement.</li>
                  <li><strong>Isolate the Victim:</strong> Create a situation where the target feels isolated from others and more dependent on you. This makes them more susceptible to your influence.</li>
                  <li><strong>Prove Yourself:</strong> Demonstrate your value and worth to the target through actions, making them see you as someone worth their time and attention.</li>
                  <li><strong>Effect a Regression:</strong> Take the target back to a time or state of mind where they felt more vulnerable or emotional. This creates a deep psychological connection.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stir Up the Transgressive and Taboo:</strong> Engage the target in something forbidden or taboo, heightening the sense of excitement and danger, which strengthens their emotional bond with you.</li>
                  <li><strong>Use Spiritual Lures:</strong> Appeal to the target’s deeper values or spiritual beliefs, making them feel that the connection with you is more profound and meaningful.</li>

        <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> Briefly, this book is a decent introduction to Greek mythology for those interested. Not really much to reveiw about since these stroies aren't original to the authour, however, be careful to form conclusions from these stories if you do choose to read this since apparently shes missed out on a few details. Anyways this doesnt take away from general understanding and if you want the stories in depth, look it up elsewhere.</p>

            <h2>The 33 Strategies of War by Robert Greene</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Robert Greene</p>
            <p><strong>Published:</strong> 2006</p>
            <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
            <p><strong>Review:</strong> This is the third book in Robert Greene's series on power and strategy and it is not surprising this is equally deserving of 5/5 stars. Building on concepts from his earlier works and drawing on historical examples from military leaders and strategic thinkers like Napoleon and Sun Tzu, Greene provides readers with adaptable tools for mastering strategic thinking.</p>

            <p>The book is divided into 5 sections: Self-Directed Warfare, Organizational Warfare, Defensive Warfare, Offensive Warfare, and Unconventional (Dirty) Warfare. Each section offers distinct strategies and examples, such as Napoleon's Blitzkrieg, Alexander the Great's decisive point strategy, and Elizabeth I's use of diplomacy. The book has faced criticism for its morally ambiguous advice and historical oversimplification, as noted by major publications. Despite this, it remains an important reference for strategic thinking and personal interest.</p>

        <h2>Klara et le soleil</h2>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Kazuo Ishiguro</p>
        <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐</p>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> This is my current read. I read this in French and have been reading it on and off during how busy adult life is now. I’m not sure if it’s that attention-grabbing. This is a dystopia, and it’s quite a slow read, which is why I’m rating it 3 out of 5. I don’t think I’d read it again, even though it is literally my favorite genre. But it was fun to read a Japanese author (who grew up in London) in French, so at least there’s that. I haven’t finished it yet and I keep tabbing the book, but I found it really boring at times. For example, it takes a while for the book to develop and get Klara out of the shop window. I appreciate that the book is incremental in that sense, but please, why isn’t there more progression? Anyway, I will finish this, but as of now, it’s looking like I wouldn’t pick it up again, which is unfortunate. I think I like it a little more because I read it in French, but this reason alone isn’t deserving of stars. It’s a shame, as I do love slow reads, but for me, this was snail-paced slow and I wanted to literally skip pages. Even if you do skip pages, it doesn’t really skip enough and you literally don’t miss much. Anyways I think the premise is really interesting with the rise in AI but, I think for me I like reading about dystopias without technology, I dislike modernity to some extent, when I read and so the fact the main character is a literal robot is a little bit of a turn off for me to say the least.</p>
        <p>Anyways I think the background of the book is overall interesting and so I have tagged it here in the following toggle. Not sure if this book is for everyone, but it's quite short, even if at times it feels like it’s longer. Actually, upon doing a little research, I don’t think my opinion is too different from many. According to The New York Times, Klara and the Sun is described as "an emotional and introspective novel that struggles to fully engage with its ambitious themes," while The Guardian notes that, despite offering a "thoughtful and delicately crafted narrative," the book can feel slow and ponderous, with pacing and plot development that may not satisfy all readers. Clearly, I think this guy missed the mark. Like, by a lot, which is harsh to realize. Contrastingly, The New York Times praises Klara and the Sun for its "beautifully crafted, meditative narrative that explores profound themes of consciousness and artificial intelligence," noting Ishiguro's talent for crafting a poignant and thought-provoking story that deeply engages readers. How sorrowfully wrong that is. Anyways the message is there, but for me, I’d never read this again and I’ll update this review when I finish it.</p>

<!-- Review for Cat's Eye -->
<div class="review">
    <img src="images/cat'seye" alt="Cat's Eye Cover">
    <div>
        <h2>Cat's Eye</h2>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Margaret Atwood</p>
        <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong>
         “A great book should leave you with many experiences and slightly exhausted at the end,” said Mark Haddon, and *Cat’s Eye* left me both mentally stimulated and emotionally exhausted by the end, which isn’t a horrible lasting effect, honestly. It shows the story was decent and made me feel something. However, it was just that—a great book, not a brilliant one. Reading it, theres just an undertone of sadness most of the way through, and the ending isnt satisying by any means since she never reallyyy gets emotional closure.

         <p>If you choose to read this, the first thing you need to fully understand is that the book's structure is subdivided into distinct phases of life—childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and so on. So, literally, you are reading the progression of the fictional life of the main character. Hence, when you finish the book, it feels like you’ve led a whole different life. Honestly, that’s what’s done really well, I think. Also, it felt like the book went really quickly, which might have something to do with how hooked I was reading this on breaks and literally anywhere I was. But, done intentionally or not, the effect could be taken as somewhat metaphorical; a reflection of how quickly time can slip away.</p>

         <p>It felt like the character's story came to an end when i eventually finished the book, and there was nothing more to tell, which, not going to lie, was disappointing, although not hugely. Genuinely, it made me appreciate life more because, to some degree, the main character seems to have gone through her life in an almost wasteful way emotionally, and I didn’t feel like she accomplished that much in her life. So the reflection of being emotionally drained at the end could be accurate even if the story emotionally isn’t a rollercoaster. But, it’s a weird feeling because she actually did accomplish a few things with her art at the end, so I’m not sure why I felt like that. Perhaps it’s the feeling that she could have gone her whole life without feeling continuously sad, which is what I found the most resonating thing. The book could thus be taken as an emotional wake-up call in some ways.</p>

         <p>This was my commute book on the train when I was 19 in 2022. Literally, I would be on the District Line to Gloucester Road or on my breaks at work and would literally have my head in the clouds reading this. I also remember reading it on a wall in front of my crush’s house at the time while waiting for him, not that the book is romantic at all.</p>

         <p> It was also an easy read, so the fact that the book is fairly dense isn’t terrible. It’s not one of those books where it’s short but dense and takes a while to read and digest, thus it makes a good commute book because you can read it mindlessly if you choose to do so, and just take the book at surface level and read it for what it is. (This in itself could also be metaphorical for taking life as it is). Separately, I’ll admit there are times you get sick of the book just because I don’t think the character progresses emotionally too much, even if that’s the whole point of the story, but that’s personal opinion. It literally feels like she’s stuck in the past as well, something I can relate to a lot actually, and I didn’t even know it. I’ll also add that I didn’t expect it to resonate as much as it did reading it as a teenager on the train, but somehow it felt more relatable than I anticipated.</p>

        <p> Anyways, I am rating it 4 out of 5, mainly because I think *The Handmaid’s Tale* by the same author is unbeatable and superior. Largely, I find the book’s message a little more forgettable. Although the message was tangible, it felt, to some degree, more like a storybook than anything else. This might be the point, but the message seems somewhat diminished and perhaps comes across as less significant.

                <h3>Summary:</h3>
                <p>Cat's Eye takes readers on a riveting journey through the life of Elaine Risley, a painter whose past is haunted by a complex and toxic friendship.</p>
                <p><strong>Childhood:</strong> Elaine's early years are colored by her sensitivity and imagination, but they quickly turn dark with the arrival of Cordelia, a friend whose manipulative and cruel behavior deeply affects her. This period is marked by Elaine's isolation at school and her retreat into art as a refuge from Cordelia’s bullying.</p>
                <p><strong>Adolescence:</strong> As Elaine grows, her relationship with Cordelia becomes increasingly toxic. Cordelia’s domination and psychological torment leave lasting scars, impacting Elaine’s self-esteem and social interactions. Despite these struggles, Elaine’s artistic talent begins to flourish, providing her a way to express and cope with her turbulent emotions.</p>
                <p><strong>Adulthood:</strong> Elaine emerges as a successful painter, but the ghosts of her past still linger. Her career retrospective prompts a deep dive into her painful memories with Cordelia. This period is marked by personal growth and attempts to reconcile with her past, even as her relationships and sense of self remain influenced by her childhood trauma.</p>
                <p><strong>Old Age:</strong> In her later years, Elaine reflects on her life with a mixture of regret and acceptance. Her retrospective exhibition becomes a form of reconciliation, allowing her to confront and understand her past. Through her art, she seeks closure, ultimately gaining a nuanced perspective on her life and the impact of her past relationships.</p>
                <p>Margaret Atwood’s Cat's Eye is a poignant exploration of how childhood trauma can echo through adulthood, brilliantly capturing the intricacies of personal growth and artistic expression. Elaine’s journey is both heartbreaking and inspiring, illustrating the enduring effects of our formative experiences and the power of art to heal and reflect.</p>

          <h2>48 Laws Of Power</h2>
          <p><strong>Author:</strong> Robert Greene</p>
          <p><strong>Published:</strong> 1998</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p><strong>Review:</strong>
              George Orwell says, “Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.” This book was just a very interesting read overall. I think the overall message can be taken too far but this book isn't getting anything less than a 5/5 because of how accurate this was to real world scenarios. This is something I think everyone should read, even if it, at times, is a hard read (in terms of how accurate the laws are thus, is difficult to comprehend that people actually are like this).  Anyways, I've added a summary of the laws here, use at your own risk.
          </p>

          <!-- Toggle for Overview -->
          <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleOverview()">Show/Hide Overview</button>
          <div id="overview" class="toggle-content">
              <p>Fundamentally, this book elucidates methods for manipulating individuals or avoiding manipulation. In the most constructive sense, literally advocating for the principle of "if you cannot beat them, join them." Remarkably, I would rate this highly, as it is directly applicable to real-world scenarios. The text is meticulously structured into 48 distinct sections, facilitating ease of comprehension.</p>
              <p>Additionally, Greene integrates historical anecdotes with an in-depth exploration of human psychology, analyzing the motivations, fears, and desires that underpin human behavior. The intersection of historical context and contemporary psychological insight is particularly compelling, revealing enduring patterns of power dynamics. Although drawing on specific historical situations that may not translate well to contemporary scenarios, it is arguable that some tactics, if not all, don’t lose meaning or strategy even today.</p>
              <p>A significant takeaway is Greene’s guidance on navigating intricate social environments, which could prove exceptionally valuable in professional settings as well as in managing overall reticence. The book further underscores the critical importance of strategic thinking and long-term planning—essential elements for the attainment of sustained goals. Despite the favorable review, it is imperative to recognize the ethical implications of the book, given that its advice often promotes self-serving and manipulative strategies.</p>
              <p>However, The 48 Laws of Power doesn’t come without considerable debate. Plato highlights that “those who seek power are often those least suited to wield it,” pointing out the red flag regarding an individual’s suitability to hold power, which isn't alluded to in this book. Readers should approach this text with a discerning perspective as well as consider the ethical ramifications of employing these principles since, ultimately, the book advocates for manipulation where it benefits you. Ultimately, however, one is free to act according to their own judgment. As Niccolò Machiavelli (from The Prince) highlights, “the ends justify the means,” which, similar to Greene, reflects the pragmatic approach to power and manipulation.</p>

      <h2>To the Lighthouse</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Virginia Woolf</p>
      <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐</p>
      <p><strong>Review:</strong> I read *To the Lighthouse* with one of my best friends during the 2022 lockdown, and we talked about it for so long together. It was really interesting reading the different perspectives, and I thought it was quite a good book to read along with. I wouldn’t call it my favorite book, but this was my fav reading experience ever just because I read and discussed it with a close friend of mine. I remember liking it and appreciating the symbolism, but I don’t recall too much about the characters. However, I really enjoyed the structure of the book alongside the imagery. There must have been something I didn’t like about it because I gave it 3 stars on Goodreads, probably because it was a really slow burner. Therefore, it gets a 3/5 star rating, just because I remember the experience of the book being the best I’ve had, albeit not the best book I’ve ever read.</p>

          <p>Woolf’s use of stream-of-consciousness writing and shifting perspectives, which I found particularly compelling, offers an intimate look at her characters' inner worlds, revealing their thoughts and feelings about their lives, relationships, and the passage of time. The novel is celebrated for its lyrical prose and innovative narrative style, offering a profound exploration of human experience.</p>
          <p><strong>To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf</strong> is a modernist novel that delves deeply into the lives and emotions of its characters. Set in the Ramsay family's summer home on the Isle of Skye, the story is divided into three parts:</p>
          <ol>
              <li><strong>The Window:</strong> This section introduces the Ramsay family and their guests during a summer vacation in the 1910s. The central event is a planned trip to the lighthouse, which never actually happens. Through the eyes of characters like Mrs. Ramsay, who is nurturing and insightful, and Lily Briscoe, a young artist struggling with her work, we see the complex dynamics of their relationships and the way they perceive each other.</li>
              <li><strong>Time Passes:</strong> The middle section covers a decade of significant change, including World War I and the gradual decay of the Ramsay home. This part reflects on the passage of time and the effects of loss and absence on the characters, capturing how life evolves in their absence.</li>
              <li><strong>The Lighthouse:</strong> The final part returns to the Ramsay house ten years later, with the family and former guests coming back. They revisit the idea of the lighthouse, and the narrative explores their reflections on the past and their attempts to fulfill the long-awaited trip.</li>

      <h2>The Handmaid's Tale</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Margaret Atwood</p>
      <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
      <p><strong>Review:</strong> “Books are a uniquely portable magic,” as Stephen King famously said. It is thus not surprising that the magic of The Handmaid's Tale has enchanted me repeatedly, making it a book I have returned to again and again. I first read The Handmaid's Tale in Year 12 and 13, and I must have gone through it at least five times because it was just so gripping. Its 2024 and every time I re-read it, I discovered something new that I hadn't noticed before, which made me appreciate it even more. I've just had to add it to my book reviews literally because it is my favourite book and I haven't ever re-read a book more than this one. Even now, it has remained one of my genuine favs, and even during lockdown, when I was reading other books, I kept coming back to it. I was obsessssedd. I remember staying up all night the first time I read it, just to find out what happened next. This book really piqued my interest in Margaret Atwood's other works and sparked a love for the dystopian genre, alongside romance. Although my classmates weren’t into this genre, I really enjoyed it and the A-level module. I’ve continued to re-read it even after graduating, and my copy is now so worn out from all the annotations and notes that the spine is practically falling apart.</p>

          <p>Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale is a profound and unsettling exploration of dystopian fiction that delves into themes of authoritarianism and gender subjugation. Published in 1985, the novel is set in the theocratic Republic of Gilead, where women are systematically stripped of their rights and reduced to their reproductive functions. Through the experiences of Offred, a Handmaid who bears children for the elite, Atwood presents a scathing critique of totalitarian regimes and patriarchal control.</p>
          <p>Atwood’s depiction of Gilead’s oppressive society aligns with Hannah Arendt’s observation that “The most radical revolutionary will become a conservative the day after the revolution” (Goodreads). In Gilead, revolutionary ideals have ossified into a rigid, oppressive regime where the pursuit of ideological purity has led to the suppression of individual freedoms. Offred’s reflections on her past life juxtapose her current state of entrapment, illustrating a poignant loss of personal identity and autonomy.</p>
          <p>The novel’s thematic exploration resonates with Aldous Huxley’s assertion, “The most important function of a society is to make its members feel at home” (Goodreads). In Gilead, the societal structure is designed to make its citizens feel perpetually alienated and controlled, stripping them of their ability to forge meaningful connections and identities. Atwood’s narrative reveals the harrowing impact of such a society on the human psyche.</p>
          <p>In various interviews, Margaret Atwood has emphasized that The Handmaid’s Tale is not intended as a feminist critique but rather a speculative exploration of power and control. She has stated that the novel reflects her concerns about the potential for authoritarianism to emerge from various socio-political contexts, rather than specifically addressing feminist issues (The Guardian). According to Atwood, the book is a cautionary tale about the fragility of individual rights and freedoms in the face of oppressive ideologies. However, I think it’s quite clear that there is deeply rooted feminist inspiration, although it is also true that most of the inspiration that she has pulled or been influenced by has either entirely come from previous/recent history or a caricature of real-world events, which all the more makes the message more potent than anything else. I find the book increasingly compelling with each re-reading. Even decades after its publication, it appears almost impervious to the ravages of time, with its message retaining a profound relevance irrespective of the era in which it is read.</p>
          <p>It must, however, also be noted that the novel has faced critique for its portrayal of Gilead as a somewhat exaggerated dystopia. Critic Camille Paglia argues that “Atwood’s dystopia is a powerful allegory, but it risks descending into the melodramatic” (The New York Times). This perspective suggests that the novel’s extreme depiction of a theocratic regime may undermine its immediate relevance and practical applicability.</p>
          <p>In summary, The Handmaid’s Tale remains a compelling and thought-provoking work that offers a critical examination of power dynamics and gender oppression. Atwood’s portrayal of Gilead’s theocratic regime, while subject to critique for its extremity and focus on Offred, provides a powerful reflection on the dangers of authoritarianism and the erosion of personal freedoms. As Atwood herself has emphasized, the novel serves not as a feminist critique but as a cautionary tale about the fragility of individual rights in the face of ideological extremism.</p>
